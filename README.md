# Upi-fraud-detection-
ðŸ’³ UPI Fraud Detection

A machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent UPI transactions using data analysis, feature engineering, and classification models.

ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions in UPI (Unified Payments Interface) systems. The workflow includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using various classification algorithms.

ðŸš€ Steps & Workflow
1. Data Analysis

-Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the structure and distribution of data.

-Examined transaction types, amounts, and time-based patterns.

2. Handling Missing Values

-Checked for null or missing values.

-Imputed or removed them based on data context to maintain integrity.

3. Data Preprocessing

-Encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.

-Scaled numerical features where necessary.

-Handled outliers to improve model performance.

4. Feature Engineering

-Extracted year and month from date fields to analyze temporal patterns.

-Created new derived features for improved model learning.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Visualized distributions, correlations, and fraud patterns using:

-Histograms

-Count plots

-Heatmaps

-Box plots

-Gained insights into key factors influencing fraudulent transactions.

6. Model Training

-Trained and compared multiple machine learning algorithms:

-Logistic Regression â€“ as a baseline model.

-Decision Tree Classifier â€“ to capture non-linear relationships.

-Random Forest Classifier â€“ for ensemble-based performance improvements.

7. Model Evaluation

-Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-Compared results to identify the best-performing model.

ðŸ§© Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ“Š Results & Insights

Feature engineering significantly improved model accuracy.

Random Forest achieved the best performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Temporal and transaction-type features were strong indicators of potential fraud.

ðŸ§ª Future Improvements

-Implement advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM.

-Use time-series analysis for transaction trends.

-Deploy model as a web app for real-time fraud detection.
